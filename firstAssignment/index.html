                <p>
                    When playing lacrosse, your stick is arguably your most important piece of equipment. If your stick is not properly configured,then
                    your performance on the field will not be optimal. With that being said, it usually is not a good idea to use a stick
                    with the factory stringing that it comes with when you first but it. We offer the highest quality strining that is
                    taylored to each player's unique needs so that you can focus on the game and not whether or not your stick will perform.
                </p>
